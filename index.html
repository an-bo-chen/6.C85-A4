		<h2>Proposition: Police misconduct within NYPD is driven by racially motivated biases.</h2>

		<section>
			<h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/for_proposition.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This figure highlights potential racial biases in NYPD misconduct allegations by showing the
					proportion of complaints from individuals of a different race versus the same race as the police
					officer. The data indicates that White police officers receive a significantly higher proportion of
					allegations from individuals of a different race, with nearly 90% of complaints against them coming
					from non-White complainants. In contrast, Black officers receive a majority of their complaints from
					individuals of the same race. The stark disparity in the racial composition of allegations suggests
					that racial bias may play a role in police misconduct complaints, reinforcing the proposition that
					NYPD misconduct is racially motivated.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(Score: -1) The title, "<i>Exposing Racial Biases in NYPD Misconduct Allegations</i>," is
					intentionally
					suggestive. It
					frames the data in a way that assumes racial bias exists rather than neutrally presenting the
					findings. This phrasing leads the viewer toward the conclusion that NYPD misconduct is racially
					motivated, strengthening the argument in favor of the proposition.</li>
				<li>(Score: 2) A horizontal bar chart was chosen to facilitate clear comparisons between police officers
					of
					different racial groups. This decision enhances readability and allows for an effective visual
					representation of the disparities in allegations. The format makes it easier to compare the
					proportion of allegations across different groups.</li>
				<li>(Score: 1) The bars are divided into complaints from individuals of the same race as the officer and
					those from individuals of a different race. Instead of segmenting further by specific ethnic groups,
					which could have introduced excessive complexity, this approach focuses attention on the contrast
					between intra-racial and inter-racial complaints. The decision highlights that White officers
					receive a disproportionately high percentage of allegations from non-White individuals.</li>
				<li>(Score: 0) Unlike the visualization against the proposition, this chart includes all racial
					categories to
					emphasize the dominance of White officers in misconduct allegations. The inclusion of categories
					with minimal complaints (such as American Indian and Asian officers) serves to underscore the stark
					contrast in the number of allegations against White officers, making the racial disparities more
					pronounced.</li>
				<li>(Score: -2) The use of dark red to represent complaints from individuals of a different race and
					light green for
					same-race complaints introduces an implicit connotation. Red often signifies negativity or alarm,
					while green is associated with positivity. This choice subtly directs the viewer’s attention to the
					large proportion of red in the White officer category.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/against_proposition.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This figure presents the distribution of NYPD misconduct complaint outcomes across different
					police racial demographics. The percentages of exonerated, substantiated, and unsubstantiated
					complaints remain remarkably consistent across all racial groups. This suggests that allegations
					against officers, regardless of race, follow a similar pattern in how they are processed and
					resolved. By showing the uniformity in complaint outcomes, the visualization challenges the notion
					that racial bias significantly influences police misconduct complaints, suggesting instead that
					external factors or systemic procedures play a more dominant role.
					<br>
					Note: <b>Exonerated</b> (indicating that the alleged conduct occurred but did not violate the NYPD’s
					rules), <b>Substantiated</b> (indicating that the alleged conduct occurred and it violated the
					rules),
					and
					<b>Unsubstantiated</b> (indicating that there was insufficient evidence to prove or disprove the
					alleged
					conduct).
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(Score: -2) The title, "<i>Revealing Equitable NYPD Complaint Outcomes Across Each Police Racial
						Demographic</i>," is
					deliberately constructed to suggest fairness in complaint resolutions. By emphasizing "equitable,"
					it primes the viewer to perceive the data as balanced, discouraging interpretations of systemic
					racial bias. This framing subtly directs the audience toward rejecting the proposition.
					Additionally, the use of "each" in the title implies comprehensive racial representation, yet the
					American Indian group is missing from the visualization. The American Indian category was excluded
					because it contained very few records, leading to
					noticeable variations in the percentage of outcomes. Including it would have disrupted the
					uniformity of the visualization, making the other categories appear more inconsistent. By removing
					it, the visualization maintains a consistent and comparable structure, reinforcing the argument that
					racial bias does not influence complaint outcomes.</li>
				<li>(Score: 2) A horizontal bar chart was chosen for clarity and ease of comparison across racial
					groups. Aligning
					outcomes from top to bottom allows viewers to quickly assess the relative consistency of complaint
					resolutions. Percentages were directly labeled on each bar segment to eliminate the need for viewers
					to calculate values themselves.</li>
				<li>(Score: -1) Displaying complaint outcomes as percentages rather than raw numbers normalizes the
					distribution
					across racial groups. This prevents White officers, who receive more total complaints, from standing
					out disproportionately. It also allows for a fair comparison between racial groups with different
					sample sizes.</li>
				<li>(Score: -1) White officers were placed at the bottom of the graph to reduce focus on them. Since
					White officers
					are often central to discussions on racial bias in policing, placing them lower in the visualization
					minimizes their visual prominence. This arrangement also highlights that White officers have
					the lowest percentage of substantiated complaints.</li>
				<li>(Score: -2) Different shades of blue were chosen to represent complaint outcomes: deep sky blue for
					unsubstantiated, sky blue for substantiated, and light sky blue for exonerated. Employing blue for
					all outcomes ensures a neutral appearance where no single result stands out prominently.
					Additionally, placing "substantiated" (where misconduct was confirmed) in the middle of the bar
					de-emphasizes its significance, subtly directing more attention to the "exonerated" and
					"unsubstantiated" categories on the left and right. This choice reinforces the perception that the
					majority of officers, regardless of race, are not found guilty of misconduct, thereby supporting the
					argument that racial bias does not influence complaint outcomes.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Reflection</h2>

			<p>This assignment highlighted the complexity of ethical data visualization, demonstrating how the same
				dataset can be used to support contradictory claims depending on how it is presented. Creating a
				visualization that supported the proposition was relatively straightforward, as the data readily
				provided evidence of racial disparities in NYPD misconduct allegations. However, crafting a
				visualization against the proposition was far more challenging as it required careful selection of
				framing, metrics, and visual design choices to remain technically truthful while presenting an
				alternative perspective. This process underscored how subtle design decisions, such as color schemes,
				data segmentation, and title phrasing, can shape viewer perception. While these techniques can aid
				comprehension, they also have the potential to mislead audiences if used unethically. For example, the bar chart
				itself was an earnest choice, as it allowed for clear comparisons, but the color schemes were largely
				deceptive, leveraging connotations of different hues to either highlight or downplay key data points.
			</p>

			<p>I define ethical analysis and visualization as the process of presenting data in a way that is both
				truthful and responsible while acknowledging how design choices can influence perception. Ethical
				visualization does not mean complete neutrality as persuasive storytelling is often necessary to make
				complex data more understandable, but it requires transparency in methodology and an awareness of how
				certain design decisions can introduce bias. The distinction between “acceptable” persuasion and
				"misleading" tactics lies in intent and impact. Acceptable choices, such as clear labeling, logical
				chart selection, and appropriate use of scale, help clarify insights without distorting meaning.
				Conversely, misleading choices, such as selective omissions, suggestive color schemes, or framing that
				implies causation without evidence, can manipulate interpretation. There is no absolute line between
				ethical and unethical visualization, as even small design decisions can shift perception. However,
				maintaining transparency about data transformations and ensuring that visualizations empower rather than
				deceive the audience is key to ethical data communication.</p>
